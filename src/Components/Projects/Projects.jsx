                        <p className='textDemo'>The Stock markets are the largest financial market in the world. The total market capitalization of the U.S. stock market is currently $40,511,838.8 million as of December 31st, 2022. Trading in the stocks is not done at one central location but is conducted between participants through electronic communication networks (ECNs) and phone networks in various markets around the world. We trade in NYSE and hold $159.33 million worth of stocks. <br />
                            The cornerstone of the NYSE market model is the Designated Market Maker (DMM). DMMs have obligations to maintain fair and orderly markets for their assigned securities. They operate both manually and electronically to facilitate price discovery during market opens, closes and during periods of trading imbalances or instability. This high-touch approach is crucial for offering the best prices, dampening volatility, adding liquidity and enhancing value. <br />
                            DMMs apply their market experience and judgment of dynamic trading conditions, macroeconomic news and industry-specific intelligence, to inform their decisions. A valuable resource for our listed-company community, DMMs offer insights, while making capital commitments, maintaining market integrity, and supporting price discovery. <br />
                            We stand new companies by funding them as DMMs and trade shares afterwards on the longer run.</p>

                        <p className='textDemo'>PL Share invests in crops for high yields. Mainly investing in technology-related farms such as Greenhouse farming, can be accomplished using multiple types of structures, depending on the goal and needs of the farming operations. They vary depending on the system, the material used to cover them and the construction technique. <br />
                            Simple greenhouse structures can be built at a relatively small expense, helping small, beginning farmers and smallholder farms in developing nations extend their season and produce more food. Simple greenhouse structures can be built for just a few thousand dollars depending on the size and materials needed. <br />
                            At the other extreme are high-tech controlled greenhouse structures replicated and managed at scale across multiple locations using farm management software. Commercial greenhouses can cost millions of dollars to build and are typically installed with high-tech management systems, including heat and humidity control, lighting, drip irrigation and fertigation, misting systems and automated benching systems for moving potted plants. <br />
                            <br />
                            Why do we invest in crops? <br />
                            ◯ Extreme weather conditions like windstorms, drought, cold snaps and heat waves are mitigated. <br />
                            ◯  Extend seasonality of crop production. <br />
                            ◯ Higher-yielding crops and stable crop production. <br />
                            ◯ Easier pest management and good protection from destructive animals like deer or rabbits. <br />
                            ◯ Supports growing high-value crops and hard-to-find plant species. <br />
                            ◯ Water consumption, pesticide and fertilizer use can be reduced. <br />
                            ◯ Maximum profit in a small space. </p>

                        <p className='textDemo'>For the first time the term "cryptocurrency" appeared in 2009, due to the appearance of the payment system "bitcoin", developed until now unknown man or maybe even a group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (Eng. Satoshi Nakamoto). <br />
                            In the first year of bitcoin is not represented almost no value, the rate fluctuated between 700 - 1600 btc for 1 US dollar. Over the next four years the situation has changed many times, there were ups and downs. <br />
                            2013 became fatal for bitcoin. At the beginning of the year it was breaking the mark of $ 31 for 1 bitcoin, just after 2 months’ rod has risen to $ 100, and by the end of the year the course was already unbelievable $ 1200 per electronic coin! <br />
                            Today the market replenished with many new cryptocurrency, some of them are already entrenched in the market, while others are just beginning their way to conquer the peaks, "survive" certainly not all, but as practice shows in recent years, cryptocurrency already firmly entrenched in the global economy, and deserves proper attention. <br />
